QUICKSTART to test Srend and Vrd with test t_* programs

1. cd src
2. edit t.sh to select/add compilers with MPI library
3. chmod 755 t.sh
4. ./t.sh   # run the test programs

Images and movies are created in the current directory, then moved
to the t_result_imagery/ directory when done.  If all went well, 
Errors = 0.  63MB of images and movies should be created.  If ffmpeg
was not in the path, movies won't exist.

It is helpful to have several CPU cores for MPI tests, but not required.
